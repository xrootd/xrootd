INTRODUCTION

The XrdFileCache library is a proxy server plugin used for caching of data
into local files. Two modes of operation are supported.

The first mode simply prefetches complete files and stores them on local
disk. This implementation is suitable for optimization of access latency,
especially when reading is not strictly sequential or when it is known in
advance that a significant fraction of a file will be read, potentially
several times. Of course, once parts of a file are downloaded, access speed is
the same as it would be for local XRootd access.

The prefetching is initiated by the file open request, unless the file is
already available in full. Prefetching proceeds sequentially, using a
configurable block size (1 MB is the default). Client requests are served as
soon as the data becomes available. If a client requests data from parts of
the file that have not been prefetched yet the proxy puts this request to the
beginning of its download queue so as to serve the client with minimal
latency. Vector reads are also fully supported. If a file is closed before
prefetching is complete, further downloading is also stopped. When downloading
of the file is complete it could in principle be moved to local
storage. Currently, however, there are no provisions in the proxy itself to
coordinate this procedure.

A state information file is maintained in parallel with each cached file to
store the block size used for the file and a bit-field of blocks that have
been committed to disk; this allows for complete cache recovery in case of a
forced restart. Information about all file-accesses through the proxy (open &
close time, # of bytes read and # of requests) is also put into the state file
to provide cache reclamation algorithms with ample details about file usage.

The second mode supports on-demand downloading of individual blocks of a file
(block-size can also be passes as opaque information in file-open
request). The distinguishing feature of the second implementation is that it
only downloads the requested fixed-size blocks of a file. The main motivation
was to provide prefetching of HDFS blocks (typical size 64k or 128M) when
they become unavailable on local site, either permanently or temporarily due
to server overload or other transient failures. When additional file replicas
exist in a data-federation, the remote data can be used to supplement local
storage, to improve its robustness, and to provide a means for healing of
local files. In particular, our intention is to avoid any local file
replication of rarely-used, non-custodial data at Tier 2 sites. As HDFS block
size is a per-file property, it has to be passed to the proxy on per-file
basis as an opaque URL parameter.

Unlike the full-file prefetching version, the partial-file proxy does not
begin prefetching any data until a read request is actually received. At that
point a check is made if the blocks required to fulfill the request exist on
disk and, if they don't, they get queued for prefetching in whole. The client
request is served as soon as the data becomes available. Each block is stored
as a separate file, post-fixed by block size and its offset in the full file;
this facilitates potential reinjection back into HDFS to heal or increase
replication of a file-block.

Extensions to the Hadoop file-system have been developed to allow for an
immediate fallback to XRootd access when local HDFS storage fails to provide
the requested block.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

1. Whole-file prefetching caching-proxy:

- Prefetches a complete file.

- When XrdPosixFile attaches an XrdOucCacheIO object a new prefetching thread
  that downloads the file to disk is spawned. The thread runs method
  Prefetch::Run().

- Prefetcher thread reads data sequentially from the remote server in blocks
  of fixed size and writes the buffers into a local file.

- Incoming read requests that can not be served from the locally available
  data are queued for out-of-order processing by the prefetcher thread.

- Information about downloaded fragments of a file is written into a separate
  info file. The info file has the same path as the data file with additional
  extension ".cinfo". The info file also contains history of all accesses to
  this file and cumulative cache statistics.

- If all clients detach from the proxy before the file is fully prefetched,
  the prefetching thread is terminated, leaving the file partially
  downloaded. The info file will keep the state for future use.

- Files in the local cache are purged as configured with the
  low/high-watermark options. When there is not enough available space to
  store a whole new file the cache IO object does not get created at all --
  requests are passed through to and from the origin server.

- Currently, the files that have not been accessed for the longest time get
  removed. In the future we plan to provide a decision plugin that will
  provide the list of files that are to be purged.


2. Partial file prefetching caching-proxy:

Partial file block-based prefetching is enabled with option '-prefetchFileBlock'.

- Each file-block of the original file is written to the disk independently,
  with its own info file. Block size and offset are postfixed onto the file name, e.g.,
    /tmp/store/data/test.root___134217728_0

- Default size of file-block is 128M. The size is configurable and saved into
  corresponding info file.

CONFIGURATION

pfc.cachedir <directory>: directory path to cache location

pfc.blocksize: prefetch buffer size, default 1M

pfc.nread: number of in memory cached blocks reserved for read tasks

pfc.nprefetch: number of in memory cached blocks reserved for prefetch tasks

pfc.diskusage <lwm fraction> <hwm fraction>: high / low watermarks for disk cache
purge operation (default 0.7 and 0.9)

pfc.user <username>: username used by XrdOss plugin

pfc.filefragmentmode [fragmentsize <bytes>] -- enable prefetching a unit of a file, 
with default block size

pfc.osslib <lpath> [<params>] path to alternative plign for output file system 

pfc.decisionlib <lpath> [<prams>] path to decision library and plugin parameters

Examples 

a) Enable proxy file prefetching:
pps.cachelib libXrdFileCache.so
pfc.cachedir  /data/xrd-file-cache
pfc.nprefetch 1


b) enable file block mode, with block size 64 MB:
pss.cachelib libXrdFileCache.so
pfc.filefragmentmode fragmentsize 64m

PERFORMANCE NOTES -- To be written up in full

Expected read-rates -- depends on application reading the data and the number
of expected clients.

Write rates from prefetching. Throttling ?!! Slow net-read-ahead to not
overload disk.

Obviously, network bandwidth.

Memory, usage of memory buffers. This could be optimized for some workloads,
to prevent disk trashing. Ideally, the proxy shouldn't read a lot from disk for
files that are being pre-fetched.


Disk benchmarking -- use fio.
