# This is a very simple sample configuration file sufficient to start an  #
# xrootd data server using the default port 1094 plus http protocol on    # 
# port 80. This server runs by itself (stand-alone) and does not assume   # 
# it is part of a cluster. You can then connect to this server to access  #
# files in '/tmp'. Consult the the reference manuals on how to create     #
# more complicated configurations and set the host cert and key for http. #
#                                                                         #
# On successful start-up you will see 'initialization completed' in the   #
# last message. You can now connect to the xrootd server.                 #
#                                                                         #
# Note: You should always create a *single* configuration file for all    #
# daemons related to xrootd.                                              #
