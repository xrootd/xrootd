/* The classes defined here can be used to implement a general cache for
   data from an arbitrary source (e.g. files, sockets, etc); as follows:

   1. Create an instance of XrdOucCacheIO. This object is used to actually
      bring in missing data into the cache or write out dirty cache pages.
      There can be many instances of this class, as needed. However, make sure
      that there is a 1-to-1 unique correspondence between data and its CacheIO
      object. Violating this may cause the same data to be cached multiple
      times and if the cache is writable the data may be inconsistent!

   2. Create an instance of XrdOucCache. You can specify various cache
      handling parameters (see the class definition). You can also define
      additional instances if you want more than one cache. The specific cache
      you create will be defined by an implementation that derives from these
      classes. For instance, an implementation of a memory cache is defined
      in "XrdOucCacheDram.hh".

   3. Use the Attach() method in XrdOucCache to attach your XrdOucCacheIO
      object with a cache instance. The method returns a remanufactured
      XrdOucCacheIO object that interposes the cache in front of the original
      XrdOucCacheIO. This allows you to transparently use the cache.

   4. When finished using the remanufactured XrdOucCacheIO object, use its
      Detach() method to remove the association from the cache. Other actions
      are defined by the actual implementation. For instance XrdOucCacheDram
      also releases any assigned cache pages, writes out any dirty pages, and
      may optionally delete the object when all references have been removed.

   5. You may delete cache instances as well. Just be sure that no associations
      still exist using the XrdOucCache::isAttached() method. Otherwise, the
      cache destructor will wait until all attached objects are detached.

   Example:
      class physIO : public XrdOucCacheIO {...}; // Define required methods
      class xCache : public XrdOucCache   {...}; // The cache implementation
      XrdOucCache::Parms myParms;                // Set any desired parameters
      XrdOucCache   *myCache;
      XrdOucCacheIO *cacheIO;
      xCache         theCache;                   // Implementation instance

      myCache = theCache.Create(myParms);        // Create a cache instance
      cacheIO = myCache->Attach(physIO);         // Interpose the cache

      // Use cacheIO (fronted by myCache) instead of physIO. When done...

      delete cacheIO->Detach();                  // Deletes cacheIO and physIO
*/
