# This is a very simple sample configuration file sufficient to start an  #
# xrootd data server using the default port 1094. This server runs by     #
# itself (stand-alone) and does not assume it is part of a cluster. You   #
# can then connect to this server to access files in '/tmp'.              #
# Consult the the reference manuals on how to create more complicated     #
# configurations.                                                         #
#                                                                         #
# On successful start-up you will see 'initialization completed' in the   #
# last message. You can now connect to the xrootd server.                 #
#                                                                         #
# Note: You should always create a *single* configuration file for all    #
# daemons related to xrootd.                                              #

# The export directive indicates which paths are to be exported. While the

all.adminpath /var/spool/xrootd
