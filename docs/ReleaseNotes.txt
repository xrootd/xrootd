     on Linux.
   * Honor the cmsd.dfs directive for locate request to avoid placing a 
     file in ENOENT status.
   * Make sure that the old client runs only in IPv4 mode as mixing modes does
     not work for a variety of reasons.
   * Accept old-style as well as new-style IPv6 addresses in the sss
     protocol. This allows the new client to use this protocol after
     it implemented IPv6 support.
   * Prevent invalid mutex operations in auto-termination routine.
   * Resolve naming conflicts within the frm that resulted from the
     statlib plugin implementation.

     (sdv) calc with reporting sum of squares (ssq) counts.
   * Make public headers compile cleanly with -Wall -Wextra -Werror.
   * Support passing cert, key paths via URLs
   * Allow testing of undefined set/env vars via if-else-fi
   * Pass user environment settings settings in the login CGI

-------------
Version 3.3.4
-------------

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Serialize sss authentication client initialization to prevent race
     conditions
   * Actually cancel the JobManager threads while stopping it - this affected
     client side fork handling (new client)
   * Restore original meaning of -adler and -md5 to xrdcp (issue #44)

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Append CGI info when retrying at a server that handshaked but never
     respnded to the request (xrdcp)
   * Do socket accepts asynchronously to prevent DNS resolution from blocking
     accepts (issue #33)
   * Warn about incomplete dirlist responses (xrdfs)
   * Cast the utilization statistics to uint16_t before printing to

+ **Miscellaneous**
   * When calling File::Stat use file handle instead of path
   * Improve handling of malformed kXR_readv responses (new client)
   * Explain parameters of xrdcopy --tpc (documentation, issue #46)

-------------
Version 3.3.3
-------------

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Prevent SEGV's when reusing a recycled protocol object under certain
     conditions (xrootd server)
   * Prevent SEGV when using the -DS/-DI commandline parameters in xrdcp
     (issue #13)

   * Fix the opaque information setting in xrdcp using -OD (issue #1)
   * Fix compilation on Solaris 11 (issue #7)
   * Fix issues with semaphore locking during thread cancellation on
     MaxOSX (issue #10)
   * Solve locking problems in the built-in poller (issue #4)
   * Solve performance issues in the new client. Note: this actually
     changes some low level public interfaces, so the soname of
     libXrdCl.so has been bumped to libXrdCl.so.1. The xrootd.org
     RPMs also provide the old libXrdCl.so.0 in order to preserve the
     binary compatibility with the clients linked against it.

-------------
Version 3.3.1
-------------
+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Correct XrdClient ABI incompatibility issue introduced in 3.3.0
   * Install additional private headers

-------------
Version 3.3.0
-------------
+ **New Features**
   * Stable interfaces immutable in minor releases (except XrdCl). Only
     public header files are installed in the usual include directory.
     In order to ease up transition of some clients some of the private
     include files are also installed in private subdirectory.
   * New asynchronous and thread-safe client libraries and executables
     (XrdCl). The ABI compatibility is not guaranteed until 4.0.0.
   * Build the xrootd protocol plugin as a shared library.
   * Add the altds directive to allow pairing a cmsd with an alternate data
     server.
   * Differentiate between packed and unpacked readv monitoring records.
   * Allow plugin libraries to be preloaded. This feature is only meant
     for MacOS.
   * Include optional site name in summary monitoring records.
   * Include optional site name in server identification record if the
     site name was specified on the command line (-S) or via config
     file (all.sitename directive).
   * Define a standard supported mechanism to obtain the default storage
     system object.
   * Provide an ABI-compatible interface to obtain a default cmsd client
     object. This patch does not change the definition of the XrdCmsClient
     object and is ABI compatible with all previous releases (DPM support).
   * Allow multiple comma separated protocols in XrdSecPROTOCOL client-side
     envar. This allows the client to select 1 of n protocols.
   * Implement new "f" stream monitoring.
   * Add new summary counters for readv and readv segs.
   * Add boiler plate comments indicating the all software is licensed under
     LGPL. No functional source code was modified by this patch.
   * Add GPL and LGPL license text.
   * Liberlize locking structure to prevent lock inversion relative to
     external locks.
   * Provide libevent replacement for Linux (epoll), Solaris (poll_create),
     and others (poll). Note: versions of Solaris less than 10 are no longer
     supported and they will no longer compile with this update!
   * Provide a libevent type replacement package.
   * Allow tracker files (e.g. ".fail") to be placed in a shadow directory.
     This is controlled by the new fdir option on the oss.xfr directive.
   * Allow meta-files (i.e. .fail file) to be relocated to a shadow directory
     using the oss.xfr directive. This avoids polluting the exported name
     space when an frm transfer operation fails.
   * Create a general place for platform dependent utility methods.
   * Add third party copy statistics to the summary record.
   * zlib compatible checksum plugin

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Serialize access to cache entries to prevent SEGV's.
   * Fix the fast response queue so that it doesn't run out of response
     slots causing a big performance penalty. This is a high priority fix.
   * Properly disarm the mutex helper when the mustex object is deleted.
   * Use correct variable to hold osslib parameters. This patch fixes commit
     2e27f87a (version checking) and without this patch makes it impossible
     to load an oss plug-in.
   * Properly check for errors when client read returns 0 and reflect true
     status. This only affects the Posix client interface.
   * Remove redundant flag indicating a running poller. This may cause the
     poller to never be woken up when a timeout value changes.
   * Fix <exp> tag in ofs statistics. It is improperly terminated and may
     cause certain xml parsers to fail; rendering monitoring useless.
   * Undo the side-effect of commit ff8bdbd6 that prevented the frm from
     sending stage notifications to xrootd; causing opens and xrdstagetool
     to hang with dynamic staging enabled.
   * Make sure the id buffer is large enough to hold all id combinations.
   * Avoid deadlock when closing a Posix File with an active preread.
   * For concurrent queries for the same file allow servers to respond to the
     query and only redirect clients to a stageable server if the file is not found. 

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Add EPOLLRDHUP to avoid leaving sockets in CLOSE_WAIT with a one-shot
     poll framework.
   * Fully integrate checksum processing into a manager node. When configured,
     it does not matter whether a client directs a checksum request to a manager
     or a server.  This also fixes bug report #93388.
   * Make sure to reflect proper range of errors during read/write operations.
     This also provides filesystem plugins full range of allowed return codes.
   * Initialize the rMon toggle to avoid valgrind complaint.
   * Fix minor issues reported by Coverity.
   * Make sure opendir() returns a null pointer when the directory doesn't
     exist.
   * Make sure that XrootdFS returns ENOENT when opendir() returns a null.
   * Make sure to use correct time to set mtime/atime after a physical reloc.
   * Prevent hangs when doing exterme copy from server to server.
   * Fix the -force option to really work for the mark subcommand.
   * Pass through error code returned by the N2N plug-in. This only affects
     the proxy server and caused feature interference.
   * Automatically exclude originating server/cluster on an enoent static
     redirect.
   * Correct typos XRDPSOIX envars should really be named XRDPOSIX.

+ **Miscellaneous**
   * Remove superfluous includes or other move includes to eliminate
     unnecessary dependencies in ".hh" files. This patch is required
     to create an EPEL conformable include directory.
   * Add port to prepare request struct as documented in 2.9.9.
   * Add pathid to readv request struct as documented in 2.9.9.

-------------
Version 3.2.6
-------------
+ **Major bug fixes**
   * GSI authentication: fix possible race condition while re-loading CA
     certificates; fix also related memory leaks.
   * GSI authentication: make sure the CA cache is not initialized twice (e.g.
     server and client inside there), and that the cache entry pointers are
     always initialized.
   * Crypto OpenSSL modules: use more appropriate way to read the RSA complete key,
     solving various issues for RH6 and derivations, included SL(C)6.
   * Make sure redirect opaque information is passed along for all filename
     based requests. This is required for DPM and EOS N2N services to work
     in all cases (most importantly, stat).
   * Make sure buffer ends with null byte before read suspension. This only
     occurs on very heavily loaded connections.
   * Fix the fast response queue so that it doesn't run out of response
     slots causing a big performance penalty. This is a high priority fix.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Properly detect external process failure and report correct error status
     to a client.  This also fixes bug report #91141.
   * [XRootDPosix] Make sure to use a supplied cache even when no cache
     directives given.
   * Make sure to return a usable path string via XrdOucCacheIO::Path().
   * Actually support 4 different redirect destinations.

+ **Miscellaneous**
   * Transparent support for new name hashing algorithm adopted in openssl
     1.0.0x (GSI authentication protocol)
   * Verbosity levels revised for GSI and PWD authentication protocols.
   * Notification of initialization option for GSI and PWD authentication
     protocols.
   * Do not repudiate file existence on an "cancelled" error during open.
     this patch addresses overloaded dCache pool nodes.

-------------
Version 3.2.5
-------------
+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Make realoading gridmapfile atomic (protect from segfault)
   * Propagate to clients proper range of errors during read/write operations
   * Fix segfault when handling writes to files that have not been opened

-------------
Version 3.2.4
-------------
+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Work around a dead-lock in the client fork handlers.

-------------
Version 3.2.3
-------------
+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Make sure read statistics are updated for sendfile() and mmap I/O.
   * Make sure refresh thread is dead before deleting deleting the keytab to
     avoid SEGV's.
   * Add missing include for compiling with gcc-4.7 (from Sebastien Binet).
     This patch is required for successful compilation.
   * Avoid segfaults when limiting number of redirections caused by failed
     authorization.
   * Avoid deadlock in the client fork handlers.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Correct monitor initialization test to start monitor under all configs.
   * Fix a memory leak in the client handshake algorithm.

+ **Miscellaneous**
   * Make RHEL6-created SRPMs buildable on RHEL5 by forcing RPM to use MD5
     digests.
   * Fuse: Use default TTL values for data server connection and load
     balance server connection.

-------------
Version 3.2.2
-------------
+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Correct test whether or not to initialize redirect monitoring. The old
     code never initialized it this disabling redirect monitoring.
   * Backport frm notification fix that stalled stage-in requests from commit
     69e38cfd6b8bb024dd34f8eb28a666fbf97f346b
   * Prevent SEGV when xrd.monitor rbuff value not specified
   * Prevent xrdcp hangs when doing exterme copy from server to server.
   * In case of 'limited proxy' look for VOMS attributes also in the parent
     proxy.
   * Correct log processing for sites that use the root directory as the
     stomping ground for newly created files.

-------------
Version 3.2.1
-------------
+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Don't build sendfile support on MacOSX because it doesn't work
   * Prevent double-free abort when more than 16 files have been opened by a
     client and the client terminates the session without closing the 17th one.

-------------
Version 3.2.0
-------------
+ **New Features**
   * Retool the XrdOucCache object so that cache implementations can be
     implemented as plugins.
   * Add FSize method to the XrdOucCacheIO object to ease implementation
     of disk caches containing partial files.
   * Add the pss.cachelib directive to specify a cache plugin.
   * Implement ultralow overhead redirect monitoring.
     WARNING: ofs plugin writers will need to recompile their plugin interface
     to be fully compatible with this commit due to additional
     information passed to the ofs object "new" methods.
   * Allow the XrdCmsClient interface (a.k.a Finder) to be a plug-in.
   * Add ofs.cmslib directive to specify the XrdCmsClient plug-in.
   * Add new class, XrdOucCallBack, to simplify using callbacks in the
     XrdCmsClient plug-in.
   * Define the frm.all.monitor directive to enable migration, purging, and
     staging monitoring. This was originally part of xrootd.monitor but that
     just was odd. Note that the stage, purge, migr events are no longer
     accepted on the xrootd.monitor directive.
   * Collapse he staging (s) and migration (m) records into a single transfer
     (x) record. While not compatible, the previous implementation was new
     code and no one actually was capturing these records.
   * Implement a server identification record (=) that unquely identifies each
     server. The record can be sent periodically and can be used as a heartbeat.
   * Add -y option to xrdcp to limit number of extreme copy sources.
   * Uniformly pass the execution environment to all oss and cms client
     methods. This is largely for DPM support.
     WARNING: While this update is binary backwad compatible to existing oss
     plug-ins it is not source compatible. Plug-in writers will need
     to modify their oss methods to successfully compile.
   * Allow an automatic redirect when a file operation ends with ENOENT.
     Allow redirects for chsum and trunc operations.
     Both of the above are controlled via the xrootd.redirect directive.
   * Report the timezone when connecting to a [meta]manager.
   * Allow configuration of staging, migration, and purging events.
   * Allow transfer script to inject information into the monitoring stream.
   * Report number of attempted login, authentication failures, successful
     authenticated and unauthenticated logins in the summary statistics.
   * Indicate whether a disconnect was forced and whether it was a parallel
     path (as opposed to a control path) in the monitoring record.

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Provide compatibility for sprintf() implementations that check output
     buffer length. This currently only affects gentoo and Ubuntu Linux.
     We place it in the "major" section as it causes run-time errors there.
   * Reinsert buffer size calculation that was mistakenly deleted.
     This eventually causes a SEGV when detailed monitoring is enabled.  
   * Remove improper initialization that may cause a SEGV in the checksum
     manager.
   * Add missing initializer without which we will get a SEGV. This is a fix
     for the just added monitoring code.
   * Remove regressions that prevent a proxy cluster from being fully
     configured.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Correct debug message frequency that caused people to think some file
     system partitions were being ignored.
   * Correct pthread Num() to return thread-specific numbers.
   * Make sure the sendfile interrupt counter is initialized to zero.
   * Make sure to honor absolute cms.space values when percentage not
     specified.
   * Prevent double user map record when monitoring when auth is configured
     but not actually monitored.
   * Take timezone changes into account when waiting for midnight. This solves
     the log rolling problem when changing between DST and standard time.
   * Make sure to cut close records for open files during a forced disconnect
     when monitoring file information.
   * Do not create meta-files or update extended attributes when placing a
     file into read-only space.

+ **Miscellaneous**
   * Bonjour code dropped
   * Complete implementation of the fstat() version of stat().
   * Consistently pass the enviroment to the cms client enterface.
   * Make return codes consistent between synchronous & async XrdCmsClient
     returns.
   * Document the XrdCmsClient interface in the header file.
   * Cut close monitor records before cutting the disconnect record.
   * Make frm_purged and frm_xfrd use sparate log files.

-------------
Version 3.1.1
-------------

+ **New Features**
   * Compile on Solaris 11
   * Add support for sending DN with monitoring information
   * Add possibility to switch off automatic download of CRL from the web;
     default is OFF; to enable it multiply by 10 the relevant CRL options
     (i.e. 12 and 13 are like 2 and 3 but trying download if the file is not
     found).
   * Add refresh frequency time for CRL's; default 1 day .

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Fix various client threading issues.
   * [bug #87880] Properly unpack the incoming vector read data.
   * Rework the handshake when making a parallel connection. Previous method
     caused a deadlock when parallel connections were requested (e.g. xrdcp).
   * Add HAVE_SENDFILE definition to cmake config. All post-cmake version of
     xrootd until now have disabled use of sendfile() with resulting poor
     performance. This fix corrects this.
   * Don't force libXrdPss.so to be loaded for proxy managers.
   * Fix various CMake issues: disable library inheritance, fix underlinking
     problems, make sure libcom_err is present when building kerberos.
   * Replace non-reentrant versions of getpwxxx and getgrxxx with reentrant
     versions. This should prevent spurious uid/gid translations.
   * Fix RedHat bug #673069: Missing header files required by DPM
   * Don't ignore errors returned by kXR_close
   * Init scripts: don't change the ownership of the sysconfig files
     preventing the xrootd user from executing arbitrary code as root

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Add 'k' to the option list. It was wrongly deleted in the last option
     refalgamization.
   * Fix a typo in the specfile causing problems with multithreaded
     compilation.
   * Initialize xattr variable name so that xrdadler32 can fetch previous
     checksum. The error caused xrdadler32 to always recompute the checksum.
   * Make sure that monitor write length is really negative.
   * Add the oss.asize hint to the destination URL in all possible cases.
   * Properly print adler32 checksum in xrdcp.
   * When the server certificate is expired, try to renew from the same path
     before failing.
   * Get the signing certificate for the CRL from its issuer hash, which can be
     different from the CA hash.
   * Add check for the format of the downloaded CRLs: DER or PEM
   * Solaris init script: switch to xrootd user when invoked as root
   * RHEL init scripts: always create /var/run/xrootd to handle /var/run
     being mounted as tmpfs

+ **Miscellaneous**
   * Relax requirements on the permission mode of the x509 key files
   * Disable client redirections reports to the console.
   * Stop doing XrdFfsPosix_statall() if task queue is long.
   * Get rid of compiler warnings
   * Improve some log messages
   * At server startup, only initialize the CA (and CRL, if required) for the
     authority issuing the server certificate; additional CA's are initialized
     only if needed.

-------------
Version 3.1.0
-------------

+ **New Features**
   * Use CMake to build the source code and retire all the other build systems.
   * Add IOV as a selectable detail to xrootd.monitor directive.
   * Provide a mode in xrootdfs to auto-update internal list of data servers.
     and extend client connection TTL from one hour to infinity.
   * Provide virtual xattr ("xroot.cksum") to obtain checksum for consistency.
   * Make xrdadler32 use the new checksum format if it is set (fallback to old
     format otherwise). In all cases, the old format is converted to the new
     format whenever possible.
   * Enforce r/o exports in the proxy server (finally added).
   * Allow auto-fluching of I/O stream monitoring (default is off).
     Patch submitted by Matevz Tadel, UCSD.
   * Make proxy honor the export list at the storage layer. This allows sites
     to disable staging via the proxy by specifying nostage for otherwise locally
     stageable paths.
   * Do not export the stage attribute to the meta-manager unless the path is
     tagged with the stage+ attrbute on the export directive.
   * WARNING: This update makes the oss plug-in source incompatible because an
     additional parameter was added to the Stat() method. The update is binary
     compatible and so only affects sites that recompile their plug-in.
   * Allow the query checksum request to be issued via a proxy server.
   * Add a query checksum interface to the POSIX interface.
   * Defines the livXrdSecgsiAuthzVO plug-in to allow easy mapping from voms
     vo names to users and groups. The plugin is configurable at run-time.
   * Allow the OucErrInfo object to point to an environment.
   * Add method to SysDNS to format an AF_INETx address into the RFC IPV6
     recommended format.
   * Allow pointers to be placed in the OucEnv environment table.
   * Extend the kXR_protocol request to allow the server to return detailed
     information about node's role. This is backwardly compatible.
   * The client uses kXR_protocol request to query for the server's role
     (to distinguish managers from meta managers).
   * The client goes back to a meta manager on authentication failure.
   * The client prints to stdout the redirections it gets. This behavior may be
     disabled by setting the XRD_PRINTREDIRECTS environment variable to 0, or,
     from C++ by saying: EnvPutInt( NAME_PRINT_REDIRECTS, 0 )
   * Set $HOST value for possible copycmd substitution.
   * Phase 1 to allow for redirection monitoring. Add rbuff and redir options
     to the xrootd.monitor directive.
   * Add error, redirect, and delay counts to the xrootd protocol summary
     statistics.
   * Allow file additions/deletion to be communicated to the XrdCnsd so that is
     can maintain an accurate inventory. This update adds the frm.all.cnsd
     directive which specifies how the information is to be commuincated.
   * Enable cmsd monitoring. For now, only [meta]manager information is reported.
   * Add new repstats config directive to increase reporting detail.
   * New class, XrdCmsRole, to make role naming/handling consistent.
   * Implement the 'cms.delay qdn' directive which allows one to tell the
     meta-manager the minimum number of responses needed to satisfy a hold
     delay (i.e. fast redirect).
   * Accept XrdSecSSSKT envar as documented but also continue to support
     XrdSecsssKT for backward compatibility.
   * Allow servers to specify to the meta-manager what share of requests they
     are willing to handle. Add the 'cms.sched gsdflt' and 'cms.sched gshr'
     configuration directives to specify this.
   * Include additional information in the protocol statistics.
   * Resize some counters to prevent overflows.
   * Add the 'cms.delay qdn' directive to allow better redirection control in
     the future.
   * Allow a plugin (notably the proxy plugin) to disable async I/O.
   * Implement a general memory caching object. Currently, this will be used
     by the Posix object.
   * Allow optional memory caching when using the Posix library. This is
     primarily used by the proxy object to reduce trips to a data server when
     small blocks are accessed via the proxy server. This requires
     configuration using the new 'pss.memcache' directive.
   * Finally implement adding authentication information to the user monitoring
     record (requested by Matevz Tadel, CMS). This adds a new generic option,
     auth, to the xrootd.monitor directive. It needs to be specified for the
     authentication information to be added. This keeps backward compatibility.
   * Add a new method, chksum, to the standard filesystem interface.
   * Integrate checksums into the logical filesystem layer implementation.
     See the ofs.ckslib directive on how to do non-default configuration.
     This also added a more effecient lfn2pfn() method to the storage system.
   * Allow native checksums to be enabled in the xrootd layer.
     See the xrootd.chksum directive on how to do this.
   * Add checksum management to the frm_admin command.
   * Allow XrdOucProg to dispatch a local program as well as a process.
   * Allow a line to be insrerted into an XrdOucStream managed stream.
   * Implement native checksums usable stand-alone or as plugins. Three digests
     are supported: adler32, crc32, and md5. An additional digest can be added
     via a plugin. Also, the native digests can be over-ridden via a plugin.
   * In XrdSecgsi, new interface for the authorization plug-in which has now full
     access to the XrdSecEntity object, with the possibility to fill/modify all the
     fields according to the proxy chain. The plug-in is now called at the end of
     the all process, after a successful handshake and DN-username mapping.
     Implementations must contain three extern C functions; see the dummy example
     provided in src/XrdSecgsi/XrdSecgsiAuthzFunDN.cc. 
     See also the header of XrdSecProtocolgsi::LoadAuthzFun.
   * In XrdCryptosslgsiAux, add function to extract the VOMS attributes; can be
     used in authz plug-ins.
   * In XrdSecgsi, add possibility to extract the VOMS attributes and save them
     in the XrdSecEntity. New switch '-vomsat:0/1 [1]'.
   * In 'xrdgsiproxy info' show also the VOMS attributes, if present. 
   * Automatically build the RPM for the xrootd user when an OSG build is detected
     and add fedora > 15 init scripts dependencies

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Do not close the loger's shadow file descriptor when backgrounding as
     this may cause random crashes later on.
   * Avoid SEGV by setting network pointer prior to loading the 1st protocol.
   * Enforce r/o path during mkdir operations.
   * Avoid segv when initializing the finder on a multi-core machine.
   * Fix incorrect lock handling for multiple waiters.
   * Fix possible deadlocks in XrdSutCache preventing the pwd security module
     to work correctly

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Properly handle the case when a site has an excessive number of groups
     assignments.
   * Prevent the response to a query from being truncated on the client side.
   * Report readv information in the detailed monitoring stream.
   * Correct default settings due to feature interactions after the fact. Now,
     oss.defaults acts as if the setting were actually specified via oss.export.
   * Actually use the N2N library of specified or implied via pss.localroot
     for proxy server interactions withthe origin (required for Atlas T2).
   * Use re-enterant versions of getpwuid() and getpwgid(). This is need for
     FUSE.
   * Correct bad english in a few error messages.
   * Set correct checksum length when converting ASCII to binary.
   * Allow the sss protocol to work for multi-homed hosts.
   * Correct definition of AtomicISM that caused the maximum link count to
     never be updated in the statistics.
   * Apply N2N mapping to source path when relocating the file.
   * Report correct port when locate is directly issued to a data server
     (before it was being reported as 0).
   * Make the default file system a pointer to a dynamic instance of XrdOfs
     instead of a global static (i.e. the Andreas Peters patch). This makes
     writing an ofs plugin easier.
   * Fix the RPM uninstall scriptlets incorrectly invoking /sbin/ldconfig.
   * Install XrdOlbMonPerf and netchk tools.
   * Fix a bug preventing the core of authentication errors to be logged to clients
   * In the krb5 security plugin, define KRB5CCNAME to point to the credential
     cache file /tmp/krb5cc_<uid> only if this file exists and is readable.
     Solves an issue with credentials cached in memory (API:<uid>:n).
   * Fix array deletion mismatches reported by cppcheck (from D. Volgyes)
   * Make sure that loading of XrdSecgsi.so fails if either the GMAPFun or the
     AuthzFun plug-ins fail to load.

+ **Miscellaneous**
   * Drop Windows support.
   * Code cleanup: remove XrdTokenAuthzOfs, simple tests, broken utilities,
     the gridftp code, krb4 and secssl plugins, obsolete documentation files
   * Make the loadable module extensions configurable depending on the platform
     (so on Linux and Solaris, dylib on MacOs)
   * Add new XrdVNUMBER macro.
   * Clean up the conditional compilation macros.
   * Remove compression related attributes (compchk, ssdec) and directives
     (compdetect) as they were never used nor fully implemented.
   * Remove the userprty directive. It was deprecated and never specified.
   * Refactor PosixPreeload and Posix libraries to prevent split initialization
     of the preload library which will cause failures on certain systems.
   * Provide automatic proxy checksum defaults when role is set to proxy.
   * Remove all references via extern statements to object instances. This
     only applies to the Xrd package.
   * Do not echo lines qualified by an in-line if when the if fails.
   * Remove the old "redirect" directive. It has passed its prime.
   * Remove back references to symbols defined in XrdXrootd package used by
     the cms client to allow for clean shared library builds.
   * Remove externs to XrdSecGetProtocol and XrdSecGetService from
     XrdSecInterface.hh to avoid having undefined references just because the
     include file was included somewhere.
   * Rename XrdNetDNS to XrdSysDNS to avoid cross-dependencies. This means that all
     plug-in developers will need to do the same as XrdNetDNS no longer exists.
   * Split XrdFrm into XrdFrm and XrdFrc. This prevents cross-dependencies in
     packages that use the File Residency Manager.

-------------
Version 3.0.5
-------------

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Avoid stage failures when target file exists in purgeable or writable space.
   * Make sure all the threads are joined when closing a physical connection.
   * Fix free/delete mismatch in XrdSecProtocolgsi et al.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Remove old async shutdown workaround patch introduced in Linux 2.3. The
     problem has been since fixed and the solution now causes problems.
   * Install the netchk tool

-------------
Version 3.0.4
-------------

+ **New features**
   * xrdcp now has -version parameter
   * xrdcp automatically ads the oss.asize hint to the url opaque data.
     This functionality may be disabled by setting the XrdCpSizeHint
     variable to 0 (XRD_XRDCPSIZEHIN in the shell).
   * The client will try to resolve the server hostname on every retry to
     enable DNS failovers.
   * RPM: devel package split into libs-devel, client-devel and server-devel
   * XrootdFS: all paramenters can be passed via command line, add -h.
   * Allow a plugin (notably the proxy plugin) to disable async I/O.
   * New class XrdSysRWLock interfacing the pthread_rwlock functionality
   * In XrdSecEntity: Add new fields 'creds' and 'credslen' to be filled
     with the raw client credentials
   * In XrdSutCache: Use XrdSysRWLock to coordinate concurrent access to
     the cache
   * In XrdSecgsi:

     - Add option to have Entity.name filled with the plain DN, instead of
       the DN hash, when no mapping is requested or found.

     - Enable cache also for authz mapping results.

     - Do not require the existence of a grid-mapfile if gmapopt=2 and there is at least
       a gmapfun or an authzfun defined.

     - Add example of mapping function allowing to match parts of the DN

     - Extend existing option 'authzpxy' to allow exporting the incoming client credentials in
       XrdSecEntity.

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Async write errors are now being properly caught and reacted to.
     XrdClient::Close will now fail if it cannot recover from async
     write errors.
   * xrdcp prints an error message and returns failure to the shell
     when some of the write requests it issues fail.
   * libXrdPosixPreload now builds with autotools and is included into
     the xrootd-client RPM
   * RPM: FFS moved from libs to client
   * Properly parse oss.asize. This because a major problem when xrdcp started
     adding this to the url which causes the copy to fail.
   * Spin connection portion of proxy initialization to a background thread.
     This prevents init.d hangs when a redirector is not available.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Test for 64-bit atomics instead 32-bit ones. Fixes build on 32-bit PowerPC.
   * RPM: xrootd-fuse now depends on fuse
   * Take correctly into accoutn summer time in calculating the time left for
     a proxy validity
   * Add support for Ubuntu 11 which uses the directory /usr/lib/`dpkg-architecture
     -qDEB_HOST_MULTIARCH` to store platform dependent libraries.

-------------
Version 3.0.3
-------------

+ **New features**
   * Change configure.classic to handle various versions of processors in a
     more sane way (this fixes several Solaris issues and atomics for i686).
   * Add fwdwait option to cms.request directive to allow pacing of forwarded
     requests (off by default).
   * Use native memory synchronization primitives when available when doing
     network I/O. This will eventually be extended to cover all other cases.
   * Add the qdl option to the cms.delay directive to allow changing the
     query window independently of the time a client is asked to wait for the
     query to actually complete.
   * Add 'pss.namelib' directive to allow proxies to pre-translate the lfn
     for servers that cannot do so (e.g., dCache xrootd door).
   * Optimize handling of shared-everything ile systems (e.g., dCache, GPFS,
     DFS, Lustre, etc.) in the cmsd.
   * Implement optional throttling for meta-manager requests in the cmsd.
   * New cmsd directive, cms.dfs, declares that the underlying file system
     is a shared-everything system (i.e., distributed file system) and allow
     for optimal configuration and meta-manager throttling.
   * Change the oss and fm components to use file extended attributes instead
     of meta-files. This affects copy, create, reloc, rename, and unlink in the
     oss layer. Migrate, purge, transfer, and most admin commands in the frm
     component. The 'all.export' directive now accepts the noxattr/xattr option.
     WARNING: If the migrator or purge options have been specified for any path
     in the 'all.export; directive then this change requires either the the
     'oss.runmodeold' directive be added to the configuration file to provide
     backward compatibility or that the name and data spaces be migrated using
     the frm_admin command. See "Migrating tp Extended Attributes" manual for
     detailed information and the new 'frm_admin convert' subcommand.
   * Avoid physical copy if the operation can be handled using hard links. This
     greatly speeds up static space token reassignment.
   * Add platform independent interface to extended file attributes.
   * RPM packaging and Red Hat Enterprise Linux compatible init scripts
     capable of handling multiple instances of the xrootd daemons. The instances
     can be defined in the /etc/sysconfig/xrootd file and then handled using standard::

       service xrootd start|stop|...
       service cmsd start|stop|...
       ...

     or handled by name::

       service xrootd start instance1 instance5

   * New '-s' commandline option for xrootd, cmsd, frm_purged and frm_xfrd
     creating a pidfile.
   * xrootd, cmsd, frm_purged and frm_xfrd now return failure to the shell
     when called with '-b' option (daemonization) and the daemon fails to
     initialize.
   * New 'EnableTCPKeepAlive' client environment option added enabling the TCP
     stack keep-alive functionality for the sockets.
     On Linux three addtional fine-tunning options are available:

     - TCPKeepAliveTime - interval (in seconds) between the last data packet and the first keep-alive
       probe
     - TCPKeepAliveInterval - interval (in seconds) between the probes
     - TCPKeepAliveProbes - number of probes lost to consider the connection broken

   * New functionality handling process forking. When enabled (via the 'EnableForkHandlers'
     env option) prior to a call to fork it shuts down all the xrootd connection management
     facilities (including the connections themselves) and reinitializes them after the fork
     both in the parent and the child process. This ensures relative fork safety provided
     that all the XrdClient and XrdAdmin instances are closed when the fork function is invoked.

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Add missing braces that caused config failure in frm_admin command.
   * Account for correct path when -M value is zero in hpsscp command.
   * In XrdCryptossl, fix for thread-safeness; solves random crashes observed on the
     server side under high authentication frequency
   * In XrdOucBonjour, fix important issue with host domain name registration, preventing
     the correct domain to be posted.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Correct file discovery propogation for proxy manager relative to meta-managers.
   * Correct oss partition selection algorithm to further spread out file
     allocation.
   * Allow underscores in set/setenv variables.
   * Add null byte after checksum value response.
   * Move mapping of errno to xrootd error code to the protocol package where it
     belongs. This also removes a cross dependency.
   * Correct RetToken() behaviour in the presence of multiple spaces between tokens and
     the previous call returned the remainder of the line (very obscure circumstances).
   * [bug #77535] xrdcp now returns an error to the shell when it fails to copy the file
   * [bug #79710] xrdcp now gracefully aborts when it encounters a corrupted local file
   * Reset the transaction timeout for the Query method.
     This fixes transaction timeout issues for clients doing only queries.
   * Rename variable to remove conflict between it and global of the same name.
   * Fix frm_admin command line option parsing so it does not trip over
     subcommand options. This also fixes a SEGV in MacOS when this actually
     happens.
   * Enable the '-md5' option when OpenSSL is present and xrootd is built with autotools.

+ **Documentation**
   * Added man pages for: xprep, xrd, xrdcp, xrdstagetool, xrdgsiproxy

-------------
Version 3.0.2
-------------

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Fix the build on Solaris 10.
   * Fix the build on SLC4.
   * Fix the out-of-the-source-tree builds with autotools.
   * Fix a segfault while doing a recursive copy from root:// to root://.

-------------
Version 3.0.1
-------------

+ **New features**
   * New application, cconfing, added to display configuration files relative to a host-program-instance.
   * New application, netchk, that tests that firewalls have been correctly setup.
   * New configure.classic option to allow use of stl4port library for Solaris.
   * New internal feature in XrdPosix library to not shadow files with actual file descriptors (used by the proxy
     service). This increases scalability.
   * Allow the xrootd server to tell the client that it is a meta-manager.
   * Support fo proxies generated by Globus version 4.2.1 in libXrdSecssl.

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Change link options for xrdadler32 to not use shared libraries. The previous setup caused the command to hang
     upon exit.
   * Remove instance of XrdPosixXrootd from that same file. Including it disallows defaults from being changed.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Fix XrdOucStream to not return ending "fi".
   * Correct network option interference -- do not turn on network nodnr option should the keepalive option
     be specified.
   * Remove duplicate option in option table used by the proxy service.
   * Compile on Solaris 11 Express using SunCC.
   * Compile on Windows using MSVC++2010.
