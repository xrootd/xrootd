.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBxrdpfc_print\fR prints status of downloaded file blocks and access statistics of cached files.
.SH OPTIONS

\fB-c\fR | \fB-config <file-name>\fR

Xrootd configuration file. Used to load non-default file system (directive
ofs.osslib) and prefix for the location of cached files (directive

.RS 5
Prints state bit for each file block.

.RE
\fB-u\fR | \fB-unit <B|kB|MB>\fR

Specify unit for file-size and access byte-counts; buffer/block size is
printed at most as kB. Downward rounding occurs for kB and MB. kB is the
default.

This option does NOT apply to JSON output format, there the unit is always B.

.RE

.RE
.SH OPERANDS
\fRpath\fR
.RS 5
Path to a cinfo file or directory for which the information is to be
printed. Path can be relative or absolute. If the path begins with root:/ the
path is assumed to be a LFN and gets translated via the standard OSS rules (in
the least, it gets prefixed by the oss.localroot). In this case -config option
is mandatory.
