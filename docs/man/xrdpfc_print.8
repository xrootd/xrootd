.SH OPERANDS
\fRpath\fR
.RS 5
Path to a file or directory for which the information is to be printed. Path can be relative or absolute. If the path begins with root:/ the path is assumed to be a LFN and gets translated via the standard OSS rules (in the least, it gets prefixed by the oss.localroot). In this case --config option is mandatory.
