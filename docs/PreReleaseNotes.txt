Prerelease Notes
================

+ **New Features**
   * Allow clients to easily load checksum objects via XrdCksLoader object.

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Recognize object deletion in the error handling path.
   * Add missing return statement to avoid SEGV during write error recovery
     under certain circumstances. Fixes bug 99002.
   * Add mutex serialization so as not to use only fcntl() locking
     as a synchronization primitive across threads. It doesn't work
     in Linux.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Properly recognize a loaded checksum as a native checksum.

+ **Miscellaneous**
