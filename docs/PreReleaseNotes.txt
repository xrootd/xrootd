Version 3.1.0
-------------

+ **New Features**
   * Use CMake to build the source code and retire all the other build systems.
   * Add IOV as a selectable detail to xrootd.monitor directive.
   * Provide a mode in xrootdfs to auto-update internal list of data servers.
     and extend client connection TTL from one hour to infinity.
   * Provide virtual xattr ("xroot.cksum") to obtain checksum for consistency.
   * Make xrdadler32 use the new checksum format if it is set (fallback to old
     format otherwise). In all cases, the old format is converted to the new
     format whenever possible.
   * Enforce r/o exports in the proxy server (finally added).
   * Allow auto-fluching of I/O stream monitoring (default is off).
     Patch submitted by Matevz Tadel, UCSD.
   * Make proxy honor the export list at the storage layer. This allows sites
     to disable staging via the proxy by specifying nostage for otherwise locally
     stageable paths.
   * Do not export the stage attribute to the meta-manager unless the path is
     tagged with the stage+ attrbute on the export directive.
   * WARNING: This update makes the oss plug-in source incompatible because an
     additional parameter was added to the Stat() method. The update is binary
     compatible and so only affects sites that recompile their plug-in.
   * Allow the query checksum request to be issued via a proxy server.
   * Add a query checksum interface to the POSIX interface.
   * Defines the livXrdSecgsiAuthzVO plug-in to allow easy mapping from voms
     vo names to users and groups. The plugin is configurable at run-time.
   * Allow the OucErrInfo object to point to an environment.
   * Add method to SysDNS to format an AF_INETx address into the RFC IPV6
     recommended format.
   * Allow pointers to be placed in the OucEnv environment table.
   * Extend the kXR_protocol request to allow the server to return detailed
     information about node's role. This is backwardly compatible.
   * The client uses kXR_protocol request to query for the server's role
     (to distinguish managers from meta managers).
   * The client goes back to a meta manager on authentication failure.
   * The client prints to stdout the redirections it gets. This behavior may be
     disabled by setting the XRD_PRINTREDIRECTS environment variable to 0, or,
     from C++ by saying: EnvPutInt( NAME_PRINT_REDIRECTS, 0 )
   * Set $HOST value for possible copycmd substitution.
   * Phase 1 to allow for redirection monitoring. Add rbuff and redir options
     to the xrootd.monitor directive.
   * Add error, redirect, and delay counts to the xrootd protocol summary
     statistics.
   * Allow file additions/deletion to be communicated to the XrdCnsd so that is
     can maintain an accurate inventory. This update adds the frm.all.cnsd
     directive which specifies how the information is to be commuincated.
   * Enable cmsd monitoring. For now, only [meta]manager information is reported.
   * Add new repstats config directive to increase reporting detail.
   * New class, XrdCmsRole, to make role naming/handling consistent.
   * Implement the 'cms.delay qdn' directive which allows one to tell the
     meta-manager the minimum number of responses needed to satisfy a hold
     delay (i.e. fast redirect).
   * Accept XrdSecSSSKT envar as documented but also continue to support
     XrdSecsssKT for backward compatability.
   * Allow servers to specify to the meta-manager what share of requests they
     are willing to handle. Add the 'cms.sched gsdflt' and 'cms.sched gshr'
     configuration directives to specify this.
   * Include additional information in the protocol statistics.
   * Resize some counters to prevent overflows.
   * Add the 'cms.delay qdn' directive to allow better redirection control in
     the future.
   * Allow a plugin (notably the proxy plugin) to disable async I/O.
   * Implement a general memory caching object. Currently, this will be used
     by the Posix object.
   * Allow optional memory caching when using the Posix library. This is
     primarily used by the proxy object to reduce trips to a data server when
     small blocks are accessed via the proxy server. This requires
     configuration using the new 'pss.memcache' directive.
   * Finally implement adding authentication information to the user monitoring
     record (requested by Matevz Tadel, CMS). This adds a new generic option,
     auth, to the xrootd.monitor directive. It needs to be specified for the
     authentication information to be added. This keeps backward compatability.
   * Add a new method, chksum, to the standard filesystem interface.
   * Integrate checksums into the logical filesystem layer implementation.
     See the ofs.ckslib directive on how to do non-default configuration.
     This also added a more effecient lfn2pfn() method to the storage system.
   * Allow native checksums to be enabled in the xrootd layer.
     See the xrootd.chksum directive on how to do this.
   * Add checksum management to the frm_admin command.
   * Allow XrdOucProg to dispatch a local program as well as a process.
   * Allow a line to be insrerted into an XrdOucStream managed stream.
   * Implement native checksums usable stand-alone or as plugins. Three digests
     are supported: adler32, crc32, and md5. An additional digest can be added
     via a plugin. Also, the native digests can be over-ridden via a plugin.
   * In XrdSecgsi, new interface for the authorization plug-in which has now full
     access to the XrdSecEntity object, with the possibility to fill/modify all the
     fields according to the proxy chain. The plug-in is now called at the end of
     the all process, after a successful handshake and DN-username mapping.
     Implementations must contain three extern C functions; see the dummy example
     provided in src/XrdSecgsi/XrdSecgsiAuthzFunDN.cc. 
     See also the header of XrdSecProtocolgsi::LoadAuthzFun.
   * In XrdCryptosslgsiAux, add function to extract the VOMS attributes; can be
     used in authz plug-ins.
   * In XrdSecgsi, add possibility to extract the VOMS attributes and save them
     in the XrdSecEntity. New switch '-vomsat:0/1 [1]'.
   * In 'xrdgsiproxy info' show also the VOMS attributes, if present. 
   * Automatically build the RPM for the xrootd user when an OSG build is detected
     and add fedora > 15 init scripts dependencies

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Do not close the loger's shadow file descriptor when backgrounding as
     this may cause random crashes later on.
   * Avoid SEGV by setting network pointer prior to loading the 1st protocol.
   * Enforce r/o path during mkdir operations.
   * Avoid segv when initializing the finder on a multi-core machine.
   * Fix incorrect lock handling for multiple waiters.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Prevent the response to a query from being truncated on the client side.
   * Report readv information in the detailed monitoring stream.
   * Correct default settings due to feature interactions after the fact. Now,
     oss.defaults acts as if the setting were actually specified via oss.export.
   * Actually use the N2N library of specified or implied via pss.localroot
     for proxy server interactions withthe origin (required for Atlas T2).
   * Use re-enterant versions of getpwuid() and getpwgid(). This is need for
     FUSE.
   * Correct bad english in a few error messages.
   * Set correct checksum length when converting ASCII to binary.
   * Allow the sss protocol to work for multi-homed hosts.
   * Correct definition of AtomicISM that caused the maximum link count to
     never be updated in the statistics.
   * Apply N2N mapping to source path when relocating the file.
   * Report correct port when locate is directly issued to a data server
     (before it was being reported as 0).
   * Make the default file system a pointer to a dynamic instance of XrdOfs
     instead of a global static (i.e. the Andreas Peters patch). This makes
     writing an ofs plugin easier.
   * Fix the RPM uninstall scriptlets incorrectly invoking /sbin/ldconfig.
   * Install XrdOlbMonPerf and netchk tools.

+ **Miscellaneous**
   * Drop Windows support.
   * Code cleanup: remove XrdTokenAuthzOfs, simple tests, broken utilities,
     the gridftp code, krb4 and secssl plugins, obsolete documentation files
   * Make the loadable module extensions configurable depending on the platform
     (so on Linux and Solaris, dylib on MacOs)
   * Add new XrdVNUMBER macro.
   * Clean up the conditional compilation macros.
   * Remove compression related attributes (compchk, ssdec) and directives
     (compdetect) as they were never used nor fully implemented.
   * Remove the userprty directive. It was deprecated and never specified.
   * Refactor PosixPreeload and Posix libraries to prevent split initialization
     of the preload library which will cause failures on certain systems.
   * Provide automatic proxy checksum defaults when role is set to proxy.
   * Remove all references via extern statements to object instances. This
     only applies to the Xrd package.
   * Do not echo lines qualified by an in-line if when the if fails.
   * Remove the old "redirect" directive. It has passed its prime.
   * Remove back references to symbols defined in XrdXrootd package used by
     the cms client to allow for clean shared library builds.
   * Remove externs to XrdSecGetProtocol and XrdSecGetService from
     XrdSecInterface.hh to avoid having undefined references just because the
     include file was included somewhere.
   * Rename XrdNetDNS to XrdSysDNS to avoid cross-dependencies. This means that all
     plug-in developers will need to do the same as XrdNetDNS no longer exists.
   * Split XrdFrm into XrdFrm and XrdFrc. This prevents cross-dependencies in
     packages that use the File Residency Manager.
