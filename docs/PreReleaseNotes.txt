Version 3.0.4
-------------

+ **New features**
   * xrdcp now has -version parameter
   * xrdcp automatically ads the oss.asize hint to the url opaque data.
     This functionality may be disabled by setting the XrdCpSizeHint
     variable to 0 (XRD_XRDCPSIZEHIN in the shell).
   * The client will try to resolve the server hostname on every retry to
     enable DNS failovers.
   * RPM: devel package split into libs-devel, client-devel and server-devel
   * XrootdFS: all paramenters can be passed via command line, add -h.
   * Allow a plugin (notably the proxy plugin) to disable async I/O.
   * New class XrdSysRWLock interfacing the pthread_rwlock functionality
   * In XrdSecEntity: Add new fields 'creds' and 'credslen' to be filled
     with the raw client credentials
   * In XrdSutCache: Use XrdSysRWLock to coordinate concurrent access to
     the cache
   * In XrdSecgsi:

     - Add option to have Entity.name filled with the plain DN, instead of
       the DN hash, when no mapping is requested or found.

     - Enable cache also for authz mapping results.

     - Do not require the existence of a grid-mapfile if gmapopt=2 and there is at least
       a gmapfun or an authzfun defined.

     - Add example of mapping function allowing to match parts of the DN

     - Extend existing option 'authzpxy' to allow exporting the incoming client credentials in
       XrdSecEntity.

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Async write errors are now being properly caught and reacted to.
     XrdClient::Close will now fail if it cannot recover from async
     write errors.
   * xrdcp prints an error message and returns failure to the shell
     when some of the write requests it issues fail.
   * libXrdPosixPreload now builds with autotools and is included into
     the xrootd-client RPM
   * RPM: FFS moved from libs to client
   * Properly parse oss.asize. This because a major problem when xrdcp started
     adding this to the url which causes the copy to fail.
   * Spin connection portion of proxy initialization to a background thread.
     This prevents init.d hangs when a redirector is not available.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Test for 64-bit atomics instead 32-bit ones. Fixes build on 32-bit PowerPC.
   * RPM: xrootd-fuse now depends on fuse
   * Take correctly into accoutn summer time in calculating the time left for
     a proxy validity
   * Add support for Ubuntu 11 which uses the directory /usr/lib/`dpkg-architecture
     -qDEB_HOST_MULTIARCH` to store platform dependent libraries.
