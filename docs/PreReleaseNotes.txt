+ **New features**
   * Add 'pss.namelib' directive to allow proxies to pre-translate the lfn
     for servers that cannot do so (e.g., dCache xrootd door).
   * Optimize handling of shared-everything ile systems (e.g., dCache, GPFS,
     DFS, Lustre, etc.) in the cmsd.
   * Implement optional throttling for meta-manager requests in the cmsd.
   * New cmsd directive, cms.dfs, declares that the underlying file system
     is a shared-everything system (i.e., distributed file system) and allow
     for optimal configuration and meta-manager throttling.
   * Change the oss and fm components to use file extended attributes instead
     of meta-files. This affects copy, create, reloc, rename, and unlink in the
     oss layer. Migrate, purge, transfer, and most admin commands in the frm
     component. The 'all.export' directive now accepts the noxattr/xattr option.
     WARNING: If the migrator or purge options have been specified for any path
     in the 'all.export; directive then this change requires either the the
     'oss.runmodeold' directive be added to the configuration file to provide
     backward compatibility or that the name and data spaces be migrated using
     the frm_admin command. See "Migrating tp Extended Attributes" manual for
     detailed information and the new 'frm_admin convert' subcommand.
   * Avoid physical copy if the operation can be handled using hard links. This
     greatly speeds up static space token reassignment.
   * Add platform independent interface to extended file attributes.

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Add missing braces that caused config failure in frm_admin command.
   * Account for correct path when -M value is zero in hpsscp command.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Correct oss partition selection algorithm to further spread out file
     allocation.
   * Allow underscores in set/setenv variables.
   * Add null byte after checksum value response.
   * Move mapping of errno to xrootd error code to the protocol package where it
     belongs. This also removes a cross dependency.
   * Correct RetToken() behaviour in the presence of multiple spaces between tokens and
     the previous call returned the remainder of the line (very obscure circumstances).
   * [bug #77535] xrdcp now returns an error to the shell when it fails to copy the file
   * Reset the transaction timeout for the Query method.
     This fixes transaction timeout issues for clients doing only queries.
   * Rename variable to remove conflict between it and global of the same name.
   * Fix frm_admin command line option parsing so it does not trip over
     subcommand options. This also fixes a SEGV in MacOS when this actually
     happens.

+ **Documentation**
   * Added man pages for: xprep, xrd, xrdcp, xrdstagetool, xrdgsiproxy
