XRootD

Prerelease Notes
================

+ **New Features**
   * Allow the definition of subordinate clusters.
   * Support multiple checksum types. Client can select non-default
     checksum using the "cks.type=<algorithm>" cgi element.
   * Implement generic matching rules to version check 3rd party plug-ins.
   * Allow the specification of xrootd.seclib default.
   * Implement dynamic plugin shared library filename versioning to allow
     multiple major versions to co-exist (currently only for security).
   * Add new security framework loader to allow external pacakges that
     linked against security plugins to dynamically load them instead. 
   * Set keepalive as the default socket value.
   * Add additional options to xrd.network to control keepalive option.
   * Allow local/local copying for new xrdcp but not for the old one.
   * Control core file generation via xrd.sched core directive.
   * Add pss.permit directive to restrict outbound connections for
     forwarding proxies.
   * Allow xrootd to handle objectid names as exports (new feature).
   * Implement a forwarding proxy option.
   * Pass along XRD_MONINFO setting and application name to monitoring.
   * Set client location information.

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Use correct flag when adding a cluster. The bug made it impossible
     to have more than one supervisor node.
   * Avoid SEGV when assigning a unix domain address to a NetAddrInfo object
     previously used to hold a TCP domain address.
   * Prevent blacklisting of all connctions when role is supervisor.
   * Avoid SEGV when no environment has been passed in the proxy server.
   * Fix bug in handling cms.dfs redirect verify that would keep the
     client is an infinite wait loop. This also affected locate requests
     regardless of what the redirect option was set to.
   * Fix client-side memory leak. Insignificant except for proxy servers.
   * Fix memory leak in the Posix admin locate function.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Do not set TCP_NODELAY for unix domain sockets as this issues a
     nasty error message.
   * Allow cms.dfs mdhold argument to be 0 as documented.
   * Provide complete portability and correct behaviour across platforms
     with and without Atomics. This patch does not change any ABI's.
   * Fixes #133 Pass the external environment to the protocol manager.
   * Squelch C11 warnings when dev_t is 32 bits (MacOS).
   * Correct header define gaurd in XrdSfsFlags.hh.
   * Fix broken readdir_r() and readdir_r64() functions.
   * Fully support extended file system features and pass those features
     through a proxy server. This fixes bug report #115.
   * Add missing initializer to the LocInfo structure.
   * Provide full error mapping for POSIX interface.
   * Prevent over-scan of the xrd.network routes option which may cause
     a config file error message and initialization failure.

+ **Miscellaneous**
   * Actually remove xmi plugin handling as xmilib is no longer supported.
   * Add a generic plugin preload function to help MacOS clients.
   * Remove useless loading the security framework from the http plugin.
   * Add new NetSecurity::Authorize() method that accepts text.
   * Properly support proxying objectids.
   * Make sure to always passhrough CGI information.
   * Honor network routing when creating the client's i/f selection mask.
   * Prevent mkdir failure in a clustered environment by creating the
     full directory path by default (can be turned off).
   * Efficiently handle replicated subscribers (i.e. managers).
