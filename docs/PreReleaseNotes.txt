Version 3.1.0
-------------

+ **New Features**
   * Allow the OucErrInfo object to point to an environment.
   * Add method to SysDNS to format an AF_INETx address into the RFC IPV6
     recommended format.
   * Allow pointers to be placed in the OucEnv environment table.
   * Extend the kXR_protocol request to allow the server to return detailed
     information about node's role. This is backwardly compatible.
   * Set $HOST value for possible copycmd substitution.
   * Phase 1 to allow for redirection monitoring. Add rbuff and redir options
     to the xrootd.monitor directive.
   * Add error, redirect, and delay counts to the xrootd protocol summary
     statistics.
   * Allow file additions/deletion to be communicated to the XrdCnsd so that is
     can maintain an accurate inventory. This update adds the frm.all.cnsd
     directive which specifies how the information is to be commuincated.
   * Enable cmsd monitoring. For now, only [meta]manager information is reported.
   * Add new repstats config directive to increase reporting detail.
   * New class, XrdCmsRole, to make role naming/handling consistent.
   * Implement the 'cms.delay qdn' directive which allows one to tell the
     meta-manager the minimum number of responses needed to satisfy a hold
     delay (i.e. fast redirect).
   * Accept XrdSecSSSKT envar as documented but also continue to support
     XrdSecsssKT for backward compatability.
   * Allow servers to specify to the meta-manager what share of requests they
     are willing to handle. Add the 'cms.sched gsdflt' and 'cms.sched gshr'
     configuration directives to specify this.
   * Include additional information in the protocol statistics.
   * Resize some counters to prevent overflows.
   * Add the 'cms.delay qdn' directive to allow better redirection control in
     the future.
   * Allow a plugin (notably the proxy plugin) to disable async I/O.
   * Implement a general memory caching object. Currently, this will be used
     by the Posix object.
   * Allow optional memory caching when using the Posix library. This is
     primarily used by the proxy object to reduce trips to a data server when
     small blocks are accessed via the proxy server. This requires
     configuration using the new 'pss.memcache' directive.
   * Finally implement adding authentication information to the user monitoring
     record (requested by Matevz Tadel, CMS). This adds a new generic option,
     auth, to the xrootd.monitor directive. It needs to be specified for the
     authentication information to be added. This keeps backward compatability.
   * Add a new method, chksum, to the standard filesystem interface.
   * Integrate checksums into the logical filesystem layer implementation.
     See the ofs.ckslib directive on how to do non-default configuration.
     This also added a more effecient lfn2pfn() method to the storage system.
   * Allow native checksums to be enabled in the xrootd layer.
     See the xrootd.chksum directive on how to do this.
   * Add checksum management to the frm_admin command.
   * Allow XrdOucProg to dispatch a local program as well as a process.
   * Allow a line to be insrerted into an XrdOucStream managed stream.
   * Implement native checksums usable stand-alone or as plugins. Three digests
     are supported: adler32, crc32, and md5. An additional digest can be added
     via a plugin. Also, the native digests can be over-ridden via a plugin.
   * In XrdSecgsi, new interface for the authorization plug-in which has now full
     access to the XrdSecEntity object, with the possibility to fill/modify all the
     fields according to the proxy chain. The plug-in is now called at the end of
     the all process, after a successful handshake and DN-username mapping.
     Implementations must contain three extern C functions; see the dummy example
     provided in src/XrdSecgsi/XrdSecgsiAuthzFunDN.cc. 
     See also the header of XrdSecProtocolgsi::LoadAuthzFun.
   * In XrdCryptosslgsiAux, add function to extract the VOMS attributes; can be
     used in authz plug-ins.
   * In XrdSecgsi, add possibility to extract the VOMS attributes and save them
     in the XrdSecEntity. New switch '-vomsat:0/1 [1]'.
   * In 'xrdgsiproxy info' show also the VOMS attributes, if present. 

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Avoid stage failures when target file exists in purgeable or writable space.
   * Fix incorrect lock handling for multiple waiters.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Allow the sss protocol to work for multi-homed hosts.
   * Remove old async shutdown workaround patch introduced in Linux 2.3. The
     problem has been since fixed and the solution now causes problems.
   * Correct definition of AtomicISM that caused the maximum link count to
     never be updated in the statistics.
   * Apply N2N mapping to source path when relocating the file.
   * Report correct port when locate is directly issued to a data server
     (before it was being reported as 0).
   * Make the default file system a pointer to a dynamic instance of XrdOfs
     instead of a global static (i.e. the Andreas Peters patch). This makes
     writing an ofs plugin easier.

+ **Miscellaneous**
   * Remove all references via extern statements to object instances. This
     only applies to the Xrd package.
   * Do not echo lines qualified by an in-line if when the if fails.
   * Remove the old "redirect" directive. It has passed its prime.
   * Remove back references to symbols defined in XrdXrootd package used by
     the cms client to allow for clean shared library builds.
   * Remove externs to XrdSecGetProtocol and XrdSecGetService from
     XrdSecInterface.hh to avoid having undefined references just because the
     include file was included somewhere.
   * Rename XrdNetDNS to XrdSysDNS to avoid cross-dependencies. This means that all
     plug-in developers will need to do the same as XrdNetDNS no longer exists.
   * Split XrdFrm into XrdFrm and XrdFrc. This prevents cross-dependencies in
     packages that use the File Residency Manager.
