+ **New Features**
   *Allow a plugin (notably the proxy plugin) to disable async I/O.
+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Properly parse oss.asize. This because a major problem when xrdcp started
     adding this to the url which causes the copy to fail.
   * Spin connection portion of proxy initialization to a background thread.
     This prevents init.d hangs when a redirector is not available.
