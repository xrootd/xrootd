Prerelease Notes
================

+ **New Features**
   * Retool the XrdOucCache object so that cache implementations can be
     implemented as plugins.
   * Add FSize method to the XrdOucCacheIO object to ease implementation
     of disk caches containing partial files.
   * Add the pss.cachelib directive to specify a cache plugin.
   * Implement ultralow overhead redirect monitoring.
     WARNING: ofs plugin writers will need to recompile their plugin interface
              to be fully compatible with this commit due to additional
              information passed to the ofs object "new" methods.
   * Allow the XrdCmsClient interface (a.k.a Finder) to be a plug-in.
   * Add ofs.cmslib directive to specify the XrdCmsClient plug-in.
   * Add new class, XrdOucCallBack, to simplify using callbacks in the
     XrdCmsClient plug-in.
   * Define the frm.all.monitor directive to enable migration, purging, and
     staging monitoring. This was originally part of xrootd.monitor but that
     just was odd. Note that the stage, purge, migr events are no longer
     accepted on the xrootd.monitor directive.
   * Collapse he staging (s) and migration (m) records into a single transfer
     (x) record. While not compatible, the previous implementation was new
     code and no one actually was capturing these records.
   * Implement a server identification record (=) that unquely identifies each
     server. The record can be sent periodically and can be used as a heartbeat.
   * Add -y option to xrdcp to limit number of extreme copy sources.
   * Uniformly pass the execution environment to all oss and cms client
     methods. This is largely for DPM support.
     WARNING: While this update is binary backwad compatible to existing oss
              plug-ins it is not source compatible. Plug-in writers will need
              to modify their oss methods to successfully compile.
   * Allow an automatic redirect when a file operation ends with ENOENT.
     Allow redirects for chsum and trunc operations.
     Both of the above are controlled via the xrootd.redirect directive.
   * Report the timezone when connecting to a [meta]manager.
   * Allow configuration of staging, migration, and purging events.
   * Allow transfer script to inject information into the monitoring stream.
   * Report number of attempted login, authentication failures, successful
     authenticated and unauthenticated logins in the summary statistics.
   * Indicate whether a disconnect was forced and whether it was a parallel
     path (as opposed to a control path) in the monitoring record.

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Provide compatability for sprintf() implementations that check output
     buffer length. This currently only affects gentoo and Ubuntu Linux.
     We place it in the "major" section as it causes run-time errors there.
   * Reinsert buffer size calculation that was mistakenly deleted.
     This eventually causes a SEGV when detailed monitoring is enabled.  
   * Add HAVE_SENDFILE definition to cmake config. All post-cmake version of
     xrootd until now have disabled use of sendfile() with resulting poor
     performance. This fix corrects this.
   * Remove improper initialization that may cause a SEGV in the checksum
     manager.
   * Add missing initializer without which we will get a SEGV. This is a fix
     for the just added monitoring code.
   * Replace non-reentrant versions of getpwxxx and getgrxxx with reentrant
     versions. This should prevent spurious uid/gid translations.
   * Handle the sessionID in a consistent and thread-safe manner. This should
     solve the problem of sessions being uselessly terminated making secsss
     less than robust.
   * Rework the handshake when making a parallel connection. Previous method
     caused a deadlock when parallel connections were requested (e.g. xrdcp).
   * Remove regressions that prevent a proxy cluster from being fully
     configured.
   * Prevent SEGV's by making joined threads actually joinable and not
     deleting object during the cancel phase.
   * Don't force libXrdPss.so to be loaded for proxy managers.
   * Avoid SEGV in ClientSid class by making it fully thread-safe. This
     largely affects xrdcp and some clients on slow links.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Correct debug message frequency that caused people to think some file
     system partitions were being ignored.
   * Correct pthread Num() to return thread-specific numbers.
   * Make sure the sendfile interrupt counter is initialized to zero.
   * Make sure to honor absolute cms.space values when percentage not
     specified.
   * Print leading zeroes in an adler32 checksum.
   * Prevent double user map record when monitoring when auth is configured
     but not actually monitored.
   * Take timezone changes into account when waiting for midnight. This solves
     the log rolling problem when changing between DST and standard time.
   * Fix various issues in xrdcp that could result in a SEGV, especially when
     using extreme copy mode.
   * Make sure that monitor write length is really negative.
   * Initialize xattr variable name so that xrdadler32 can fetch previous
     checksum. The error caused xrdadler32 to always recompute the checksum.
   * Add 'k' to the option list. It was wrongly deleted in the last option
     refalgamization.
   * Make sure to cut close records for open files during a forced disconnect
     when monitoring file information.
   * Do not create meta-files or update extended attributes when placing a
     file into read-only space.

+ **Miscellaneous**
   * Complete implementation of the fstat() version of stat().
   * Consistently pass the enviroment to the cms client enterface.
   * Make return codes consistent between synchronous & async XrdCmsClient
     returns.
   * Document the XrdCmsClient interface in the header file.
   * Cut close monitor records before cutting the disconnect record.
   * Make frm_purged and frm_xfrd use sparate log files.
