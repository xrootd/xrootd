Description: Extended ROOT file server
 The Extended root file server consists of a file server called xrootd
 and a cluster management server called cmsd.
 .
 The xrootd server was developed for the root analysis framework to
 serve root files. However, the server is agnostic to file types and
 provides POSIX-like access to any type of file.
 .
 The cmsd server is the next generation version of the olbd server,
 originally developed to cluster and load balance Objectivity/DB AMS
 database servers. It provides enhanced capability along with lower
 latency and increased throughput.
